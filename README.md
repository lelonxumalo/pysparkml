# Machine Learning using PySpark

This notebook illustrates classification and regression ML libraries in Spark with the help of open source datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/) and power plant data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00294/)

- A. Classification: (we build ML classifier models for species of the iris plant)
    - Naive Bayes
    - Multilayer Perceptron
    - Decision Trees
- B. Regression: (we build ML regression models to predict power generated at a plant using defining features)
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree Regression
    - Gradient-boosted Tree Regression
